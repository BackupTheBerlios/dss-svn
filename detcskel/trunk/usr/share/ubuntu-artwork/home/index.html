<h1>Welcome to Ubuntu Linux 5.04: The Hoary Hedgehog Release</h1>

<p class="documentDescription">"Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others". The Ubuntu Linux
distribution brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.</p>

<p>Ubuntu Linux is a complete open source operating system built around the
Linux kernel.  The Ubuntu community is made up of software developers,
translators, folks who love to write documentation, and most importantly the
people who use Ubuntu every day. We invite you to join this community and help
to make Ubuntu the operating system your family and friends and office
colleagues will love to use. Help to translate Ubuntu into your own language,
test it on new laptops, servers and other exciting hardware, improve the web
site with hints, tips and FAQ's, or help to define the set of software that is
installed by default for future Ubuntu releases.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu
Manifesto: that software should be available free of charge, that software
tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any
disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter
their software in whatever way they see fit. For those reasons:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 3em">

<li><b>Ubuntu will always be free of charge</b>, and there is no extra fee for
the "enterprise edition", we make our very best work available to everyone on
the same Free terms.</li>

<li>Ubuntu includes the <b>very best in translations and accessibility
infrastructure</b> that the Free Software community has to offer, to make
Ubuntu usable by as many people as possible.</li>

<li>Ubuntu is released regularly and predictably; a <b>new release is made
every six months</b>. You can use the current stable release or the current
development release. Each release is supported for at least 18 months.</li>

<li>Ubuntu is entirely <b>committed to the principles of open source software
development</b>;  we encourage people to use open source software, improve it
and pass it on. </li>

</ul>

      <li>The <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/wiki/">Ubuntu Wiki</a>, where we collaborate on the policies and strategy documents that define the direction Ubuntu will follow.</li>
      <li>Chat with the community on Freenode IRC Channel: #ubuntu</li>

<p>Welcome to Ubuntu!</p>

<h2>The Wonderful World of Linux</h2>

<p>Ubuntu uses the Linux "kernel", the software which has come to define
the worldwide movement to embrace open source software. Find out more about
Linux at <a href="http://www.linux.org/">linux.org</a>.</p>

<h2>The GNOME Desktop</h2>

<p>The desktop environment (panels, menus, desktop, file browser) that you
find installed by default on your Ubuntu computer is written by the
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME Project</a>. Visit their web site
to find out how this project is taking the desktop software world by
storm.</p>

<h2>Debian</h2>

<p>The Ubuntu operating system is based on the superb work of the
Debian community. We owe the Debian team a tremendous debt of
gratitude for their commitment to free software. Find out more about
Debian at the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian Project</a>
web site.</p>

<h2>OpenOffice.org</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes the excellent OpenOffice.org Business
Productivity software suite. This includes a word processor,
spreadsheet and presentation combination that is largely
compatible with other widely used Office software. Read more
