This file has a list of bugs or misfeatures  with other systems that affect
Unionfs.  To see a somewhat comprehensive list of Unionfs bugs visit
http://bugzilla.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu.

The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.  This
means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.  If you want to use
copy-on-write with NFS compile with -DNFS_SECURITY_HOLE.  If this flag is set,
then Unionfs will apply standard Unix permissions to files on NFS.

The PPC module loading algorithm has an O(N^2) loop, so it takes a while to
load the Unionfs module, because we have lots of symbols.

Older versions of Reiser4 don't work with Unionfs, because they can't handle
seeking through directories properly.
