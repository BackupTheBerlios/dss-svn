What is deliver?
----------------

Deliver is a scripts set that allow you to boot up your pure debian/ubuntu
system from a cdrom or even hd.
It can autoconfigure your environment, and it can generate an xorg.conf file.
It doesn't use any kudzu or hwdata package, but i suggest you to use discover1.

-------------------------------------

Usage
-------

Just deboostrap the base system and add the packages you like (or use debaser),
generate a module with make-mod script, and generate the hwconf module in the
same way:

eg: make-mod deliver 7_hwconf
